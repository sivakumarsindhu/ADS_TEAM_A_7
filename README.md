**ABSTRACT**
Crime is a major social and economic problem in almost every country, which threatens the safety of its citizens and also disrupts the economy of that nation. Understanding patterns in criminal activity will allow us to predict the crimes that may occur in the future and also predict their “hotspots” (the areas where they are most prominent to occur) and enables the authorities to more effectively and efficiently allocate manforce and resources to prevent or respond to incidents.
This Streamlit web application leverages Python, Streamlit, and various libraries for real-time incident reporting, crime data visualization, and major possible crime occurrence area prediction. The backend is powered by Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Geopandas for geographic data handling, and Folium for interactive mapping. Users can report incidents through an intuitive Streamlit interface, with incident data dynamically stored in a CSV file for ongoing analysis. The application features a map-based visualization of historical crime data, including hotspots represented through a heatmap. To enhance user awareness, a K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to predict major possible crime occurrence areas, providing an additional layer of insight. The application aims to empower users and law enforcement with actionable insights derived from geospatial crime data.This abstract provides more details about the technologies used, including Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Geopandas, and Folium. It emphasizes the seamless integration of these technologies to create a user-friendly and informative crime prediction and reporting web application.
